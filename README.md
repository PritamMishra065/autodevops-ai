# autodevops-ai

Minimal scaffold for autodevops-ai project.

Structure added:

- backend/app.py (Flask app)
- backend/agents/*.py (agent stubs)
- backend/storage/*.json (data files)
- backend/services/*.py (service stubs)
- backend/workflows/kestra.yaml
- frontend/dashboard.jsx
- frontend/api/webhook.js

Next steps: install dependencies (`flask`) and extend stubs with real logic.
